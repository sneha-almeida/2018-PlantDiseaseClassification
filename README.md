# Tomato Plant Diseases Identification from Leaf Images 
This system detects the disease that a plant(tomato plant) is suffering from by processing its leaf based on the data. This system has been trained on over 5000 images and is capable of detecting the following diseases:
1) Bacterial Spot
2) Healthy
3) Late Blight
4) Septoria
5) Spider Mites

The System has the following Functions:
1) Taking an image and Email id from the user 
2) Detecting the disease its is suffering from (using Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Multi-Level Perceptron)
3) Automated Creation of a PDF giving the details of the prediction and the performance details of the Algorithms involved, alongwith the details of the Python Libraries used
4) Automated Email facility which sends the PDF generated in the previous step to the designated user(whose email ID is obtained in step 1) programatically
